# Full Stack Foundations

This is the repository I used while following the [Full Stack Foundations](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud088/) course at Udacity.

## Restaurants app

A basic restaurant/menu management system. It involves :

- A Flask backend, defining views for CRUD operations and providing API endpoints to the database of restaurants and menu items ;
- An HTML5/CSS3, SASS-powered frontend for styling and layout.

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `virtualenv` and install the `requirements.txt` (SQLAlchemy, Flask)
3. `cd restaurants/flask`
4. `python restaurants.py` (the server will run on port 5000).
